1. Capability to add comments in objectives-details page (which displays history of
  comments...)...yes, let's
  once again try using a bootstrap modal dialog or maybe even a jQuery modal
  dialog...or do we prefer to just have a hidden div like we did for
  adding and editing objectives in the objectives screen?

2. After "add comments", do re-assign with comments, as in celoxis...

3. prerequisite: to #2: begin using "users" from a dropdown from the
   users collection, [add login, full name, email ] embedding their ids in the document...

4. admin screens: user new and edit -- login, full-name, email, password,...

5. pre-requisite to #4: assign admin levels, or perhaps simply
   "admin=true/false" for starters...?

6.  email notifications - "You have been assigned this task:"
  But we'll need to break out "users" first...
  ...time to go ArangoDB or MySQL...?

7. begin using "status" from a dropdown from a new collection, similar to celoxis:
       [ "Open", "In Progress", "Ready for Testing", "Verified", "Completed",
"Duplicate", "Cancelled", "Z - On Hold"]
       and how about "Pending"...?

  (I thought we already have something like this, no...?)

* [x-2017-04-19] Tablet Friendly Edit/Update: Use bootstrap columns (as for filters)
  intstead of a table row

* Table Friendly Edit/Update: See if we can get [+] and [CSV Download]

1. [x] Authorization
2. [x] Update Objective Functionality
3. [x-WED-2017-02-15] Add Objective Functionality
4. [x-TUE-2017-02-21] Delete Objective Functionality
5. [x-2017-03-02] CSV Download
6. [x] Inform end user if authorization is required.
   (for now just use Alert if global "user" is not set)
   Perhaps use $http interceptors...

   Or instead of sending HTTP 401 - Unauthorized, send a special
   error message in the JSON response - {"error": "You must be logged in to delete an objective."};
